## LEARNING TYPESCRIPT

 TypeScript - superset of JavaScript that adds types to make the language scale.
 
- learning how to apply types to complex data structures like arrays and objects;
- how to combine individual types into flexible combinations;
- gaining insights into the runtime behavior of the code by narrowing down what union types;
- advancing knowledge of TypeScript to use interfaces and other means of typing objects.
